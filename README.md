"This program creates a colourful square fractal using 2D graphics. Since the 2D graphics 
class extends the Graphics class, all of the methods I used are from the superclass. 
For this version I rounded all my rectangle's corners, and added a wavy background. I think
This could be used for a flag or blanket or something like that."

If anyone actually makes a flag or blanket from this pattern, PLEASE send it to me ðŸ¤£
